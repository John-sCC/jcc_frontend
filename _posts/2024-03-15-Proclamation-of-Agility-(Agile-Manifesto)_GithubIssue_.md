## Article I: Values

**Prioritization on Collaboration:**
We prioritize connections and collaboration among colonies (JCC members) and citizens (students and staff). This was first established the previous trimester when we questioned teachers on ways to improve commonly used resources. We will follow this up each week with team meetings with every colony.  

**Working Resources and Comprehensive Documentation:**
Although there are times when it is better to focus only on functionality rather than documentation, this is not one of these cases, as we are creating a momentous site to aid citizens of all backgrounds. By documenting our process, we will display our knowledge on our task and make it easier for others to understand our progress.

**Orderly Decision-Making:**
Due to the importance of this task, it is essential that we remain organized for optimal creation speed, especially considering the sheer number of colonies in this nation. Therefore, we have designated heads of each sub-colony who will be tasked with giving out roles, closing pull requests, and communicating progress made each week to the other heads. 

## Article II: Principles
**Responding to Change over Following a Plan:** 
Change is a never-ending process of human experience, and it's essential that we are able to account for it. Citizens' needs may change as time passes, and we embrace this as a natural part of the student experience. To ensure the most optimal website we will continue iterating and refining resources based on feedback.

**Quick Iterations over Lengthy Development Cycles:** 
We prioritize delivering incremental improvements to the student resources page, allowing for rapid adaptation to emerging needs and priorities. Thus, we will be showing tangibles approximately every ten days and reviewing with the President (Mr. Mortenson).

**Continuous Feedback over Periodic Reviews:**
We will attempt to create a resource page that will be continued even after our departure, one that remains relevant and valuable for all citizens. This can only be done with empowered members who contribute meaningfully to enhancing student resources. Fostering a culture of autonomy and accountability will ensure this.


## Article III: Practices

**Regular Reviews:**
In addition to reviewing with the President, we will be discussing plans on how to continue forward with the other colonies and receive suggestions for updates and enhancements in general, this will serve as an opportunity to gather feedback 
guiding our future iterations and ensuring alignment with evolving student needs.

**User-Centric Design:**
Our design process will prioritize the needs and preferences of the citizens, ensuring that resources are intuitive, accessible, and impactful. 

**Continuous Integration and Deployment:**
We will streamline the integration and deployment of resource updates, enabling us to deliver improvements to citizens swiftly and efficiently. By embracing continuous integration and deployment practices, we can ensure that our resources remain up-to-date and responsive to changing requirements.

**Transparent Communication:**
Maintaining open and transparent communication channels is paramount to our success. We will foster a collaborative environment where colonies can freely exchange ideas, share insights, and stay informed about project progress. Transparent communication will enable us to work cohesively toward our shared goals.
