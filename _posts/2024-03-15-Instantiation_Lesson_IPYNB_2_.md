# 2.1: Instances of Classes
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects with the same behavior and defined attributes.
- An Object is a specific entity, made from a class, that you can manipulate in your programs.
- Objects are instances of classes with variables used to name them.
- Each object has behaviors and attributes that are defined by the class that was used to create it
