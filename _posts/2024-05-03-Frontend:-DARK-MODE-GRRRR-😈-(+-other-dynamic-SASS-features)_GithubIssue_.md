SASS including dynamically switching features on and off (ie dark mode, colors), how to manage files and features in Version Control. 

Here are existing SASS documents [basic](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher_portfolio/2023/12/10/SASS_basics_IPYNB_2_.html) and [advanced](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher_portfolio/2023/12/11/SASS_advanced_IPYNB_2_.html). 

But, neither really go over architecture, so I think they are both basic.
