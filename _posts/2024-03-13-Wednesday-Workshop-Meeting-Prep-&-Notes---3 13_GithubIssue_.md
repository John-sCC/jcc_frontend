# Meeting Prep:

## Requirements:
- Focus on one FRQ Type
   * We are going to try again with FRQ 1 (Methods & Control Structures)
   * You can read about the FRQ Types [here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam)
- Lessons should assist with FRQ
   * For example, iteration would be useful for FRQ 2 and 4
- ~3 teachers per period (videos are SUPPLEMENTAL)
- <10 minutes of lesson, <10 minutes of hacks

## Suggestions:
- Merged hacks to save time, like a collegeboard FRQ and each team makes a different sub-question
   * i.e. a methods and control structures question with use of 2D arrays, questions for iteration and if/else
- Reschedule this week's workshop
   * Ideally to this Friday, with hacks due Monday/Tuesday

## Planning:
1. Divide and conquer FRQs of the specified type, with detailed notes about the necessary things for these FRQs
2. From FRQ investigation, identify useful teaching topics related to the FRQs (This will be another meeting)
3. Verify teaching topics with Mortensen if possible
4. Each team returns to make their individual lessons (<10 minutes each!)
5. Return to meeting to create combined FRQ hacks, totaling to ~30-50 minutes
