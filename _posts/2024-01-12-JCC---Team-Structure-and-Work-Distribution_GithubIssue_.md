## Roles

In progress as we conclude exactly which features we'll include.

| Name | Official Role | Responsibilities/Interests for Development |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Drew | Scrum Master (Period 1) | Teacher/Student backend development, connections |
| AJ | Backend Dev | Quiz and assignment storage, quiz frontend, websocket? |
| Ekam | Frontend Dev | Table generation and customization/saving, sign-in frontend |
| Aiden | Scrum Master (P3) | Wireframes for whole site |
| Ishi | Frontend Dev | QR Code Interface, OCR |
| Toby | DevOps | Stapplet Backend |
| Raymond | Backend Dev | Other data manipulation |

### Work Emphasis

Period 1 JCC members will focus on general services not specific to data science due to smaller team size, but to account for a relative decrease in complexity, they will be primarily responsible for creating the Teacher and Student objects/databases in the backend to be used for more specific data science backend resources.

Period 3 JCC members will focus mostly on data-science-related services, including backend objects used for storage to each student. This entails converting data to graphs (sounds complicated), etc.

## Communication

- Issues on Scrum Board
- Slack (VERY active)
- Meetings at lunch AT LEAST once a week (currently on a streak)

Meetings should discuss:
- Current state of tasks
- Individual contributions throughout the previous week
- Top priorities in the coming week, create task list

These should be saved in an issue on the Scrum Board for documentation.
