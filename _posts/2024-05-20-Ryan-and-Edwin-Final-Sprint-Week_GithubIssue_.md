# Objective
The objective of this final week/sprint is to pull together and make sure that OUR INBOX WORKS. Our feature is basically an inbox that will allow students to send mail to certain people and students. It is basically just like Canvas inbox and it allows students and teachers, or even students and students to contact each other.

Currently, the inbox feature works, and the inbox uses GET and POST methods to make letters. The next step for this is to create more functionality for it and make it more similar to an actual inbox. This can only be hard-coded in once the actual SASS is complete for this page. *Refer to wireframes*

Another thing that will have to be hard-coded is sending messages to actual users such as toby@gmail.com to toby@gmail.com, which does work right now, but will have to be implemented

## Tasks
- Copy the wireframes provided and actually make the SASS Files
- Replace ID tag with the date it was sent

## Next Steps
Make the Perfect Best Ideal Paramount Unsurpassed Ultimate Utmost Optimum Epitome of Peaks of Pinnacles of all CSA SASS Lessons which has somewhat been started. The whole group's idea is to make a video series that is similar to Khan Academy but is entirely for SASS Lessons. Given that most of the students in our group are Seniors, we have a deadline of 05/31, so it might not be enough time to make assignments, but should be enough to make a video series.

Our partnership has been working on this as a side project on a branch called *SASSy*. We are basing it off of this [website](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-video-game-aggregator/episodes/1)

Tasks for this:.
- Make the SASS for the SASS video series
- Implement the video series code
- Refer to issue #87 for the Group Tasks
- Make the padding for the video when it is opened
- Make script for duration of video watched

## Requirements:

- A working inbox that fits with the theme of Del Norte nighthawkcoders
- A SASS video series that future CSSE/CSP/CSA students will find useful to watch and help them implement into their projects
- An improved site search function that previews blogs within the page
- Implement Wireframes into the projects

## Schedule
Monday: Share plan with team and share at the lunch meeting. Update team especially the 3 branches of power about our status of the inbox and the upcoming plans and implementation of the video series.

Tuesday: Work in pair coding for the inbox and finalize the SASS portion of the inbox (refer to wireframes)

Wednesday: Finish the SASS portion of the wireframes and start developing methods in the backend for all functionality in the inbox

Thursday: Test the code for the inbox and reaffirm it actually is correctly working

Friday: Finalize an issue, create a pull request, and correct any errors that branches of power bring about in the pull request
