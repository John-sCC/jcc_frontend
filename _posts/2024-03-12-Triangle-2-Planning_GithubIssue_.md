*lessons will be made interactively via the terminal and a jupyter notebook.

- One demo that will be shared between object instantiation and 2D arrays

# 2D arrays
- A farming simulator will be made with 2D arrays, each index of each array will represent a stalk of corn. The program will iterate through this array to add/remove corn stalks, and display the field of corn.

# Instances of Classes
- Farming simulator will also be used for this lesson to help
- Basically the farming game will be the game used to teach all 3 lessons after

# Object Instantiation
- Each stalk of corn in the array will be represented by an object for more efficient storage of data. This will demonstrate how to instantiate objects when we iterate through the 2D array to define an object for each stalk of corn.
- For the corn object store different variables like age and moisture and use this to determine the stage of growth for each stalk of corn in a method.

# Lesson Divisions
The plan is to make the lesson equally, because these are all topics that have been done and that can be used to make sure that it is equally divided. We really just want it to be equal to one another. We are thinking to have Object Instantiation and Class Instances combined somewhat because they are both very short and simple, and they all go hand in hand. I think we can spend 2 minutes here, and then spend 2 minutes on 2D Arrays, and then like 3 or 4 minutes on the farming game and explain the connection between the 3.
