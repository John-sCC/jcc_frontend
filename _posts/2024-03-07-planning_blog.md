## Communication

Our team primarily used Slack last trimester, but after our large team we no longer fit in a slack DM which has a limit of 8 people. Instead we have transition to discord, something we are all familiar and comforable with.

Here is what the homepage of our discord server looks like. We have multiple channels (seen on the right) and multiple roles (seen through the different colors by people's names). Roles correspond to both triangle group and period number. We also have channels for coding help, general channels, important announcements, and resources like our two github repositories and our scrum board.

Here is where our group submits any issues that we need for a review. For example, the current issue is the debugging issue which each member has submitted here, which one of our team leaders will then organize into a single issue.

Here are what the roles in the discord server look like. These roles allow us to better identify and organize who is in each group, as well as communicate only with specific groups through discord's ping features.
