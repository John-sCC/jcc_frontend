## Team Resources/Methodology

### Branches and Merging

We're still definitely sticking with the branch-based approach to team organization. We've updated all new members on this and, if you look at individual contributions, you'll see some new examples of this.

### Scrum Board

We're continuing our board-oriented scrumming organization device [linked here](https://github.com/orgs/John-sCC/projects/1).

### Communication

Our team primarily used Slack last trimester, but after our large team we no longer fit in a slack DM which has a limit of 8 people. Instead we have transition to discord, something we are all familiar and comforable with.

Here is what the homepage of our discord server looks like. We have multiple channels (seen on the right) and multiple roles (seen through the different colors by people's names). Roles correspond to both triangle group and period number. We also have channels for coding help, general channels, important announcements, and resources like our two github repositories and our scrum board. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/DiscordIssues.png" width="800px">

Here is where our group submits any issues that we need for a review. For example, the current issue is the debugging issue which each member has submitted here, which one of our team leaders will then organize into a single issue.

Here are what the roles in the discord server look like. These roles allow us to better identify and organize who is in each group, as well as communicate only with specific groups through discord's ping features. 

## Team Progress

### Student Lessons

Our lessons will be covered by subteam 2 (Aiden, Ryan, Edwin) and we will be teaching **instances of classes**, **object instantiation**, and **2D arrays**. 

* Bulk of lessons handled by Ryan and Edwin
* Code review from Aiden then to other heads (Toby and Drew)
