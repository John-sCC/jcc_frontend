- IF NOT SIGNED IN: the page displays basic information about what is offered on the site. We don't have a wireframe for what that should look like currently, but it's easy HTML/CSS/cool DNHS images
- IF SIGNED IN: Rows for
    - Class periods (leadership)
    - Class periods (student/non-leadership)
    - Redirect to graphing
        - If possible, fetch graph data so that names of previous graphs can be displayed in a row to be re-opened. In the backend, this would likely be with a URL query unless we wanted to store the necessary data for a fetch locally
