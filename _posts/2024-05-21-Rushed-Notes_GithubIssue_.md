Goal: present on tuesday
Ishi and Ekam working on dark and light mode
Stacks and Queues needed
Sorting by due date
Stats
Split up on p1 and p3 prez
I did that
He doesnt like it
He wants a very simple demonstration
Here’s my stuff, here’s my code, and here’s what I’ve done so far
P1: inbox, dashboard, saas/darkmode, user creation (maybe)
P3: stats, assignment, grading, preview, class period creation
Before we review, we should make issue and make a progression of what we are going to review, this our resources, this our stuff and such
Lesson videos
Aiden wanted to do videos
A notebook would be the easiest; he wants it to be more advanced and such
Aiming for Tuesday at review:
Kevin Du: Sign Up/Search Class creation
