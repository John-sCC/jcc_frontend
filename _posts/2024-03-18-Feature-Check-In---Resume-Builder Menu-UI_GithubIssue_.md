<h4> This is for the Big Project Feature Check #1. This feature is not at a point where I can make a pull request, so this issue will be used for the review </h4>

------------------------------
<h2> Menu </h2> 

The menu was changed to implement one of the wireframes. I was having trouble matching the wireframe exactly, so I replicated the idea using a simpler design.

Each of the colored sections would take you to a page that contains one of our features. 

<h2> Resume Builder </h2>

One of the features we talked about creating in a stand-up meeting was a resume builder. We wanted to bring in some of the features the newer members of our team were working on. But also this would allow us to have a career oriented aspect to our project, which would fit in a website made for high-schoolers.

The user is given input boxes to fill out information that would typically be found on a resume. The form has multiple tabs that divide the resume down into sections.

Once the user fills out the information on a tab, they would click "Save Info" before moving onto the next tab. At any time, the user can click "See the Resume", which opens up a new tab, which has the frame of the resume filled out with whatever information the user has inputted so far.

<h3> What is left for this Feature </h3>

I still need to finish out the rest of the form to include the rest of the section in the resume. This should be fairly easy, since the process is the same and I just need to repeat it for the other tabs. 

I also need to finish styling the page, since at the moment it looks kind of unfinished. 


<h3> Possible Future Additions </h3>

So far, the feature works by storing all inputs in local storage. A good addition would be to add backend to have the information stored more permanantly
