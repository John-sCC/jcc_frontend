## Objective
Our main objective these final few weeks will be related to SASS and its implementation in our project. Over the past few months we have been taking CS courses in Del Norte, we have noticed that many groups attempt to use SASS but are ultimately unable to utilize it fully. This has inspired us to make a functional dark mode page and lessons, for students interested in SASS. Since having good and functional styling is key to getting supporters, we hope that these features will aid students to have a better understanding of styling and be able to implement it into their projects later in life. 

## Tasks

- Create a series of lessons explaining various features of SASS in depth. The goal is to show how to best use SASS beyond just the basic features shown in an introductory course.
- Record the lessons. Try to include interactive portions that our audience can access and use to get a hands-on learning to better understand how SASS works 
- Implement some of the more complex features of SASS we teach into our own project. We especially want to include a dynamic dark mode into our project. We want the dark mode to be as automated as possible, so that the styling of each page doesnâ€™t have to be changed individually when dark mode is on. We hope to make use of the SASS variable that are already built into our project to make this happen 


## The Plan
Week of 05/20 to 05/24

**Monday - Tuesday:**

- Ishi: Start planning out which topics will be used in the lessons. Start researching the topics to decide what to teach if time 
- Ekam: Research how a dynamic SASS mode can be created. Start testing different methods and decide which will work best for our project 
- TUESDAY: pair check in	

**Wednesday - Thursday:**

- Ishi: Begin writing a script for the lessons and creating other aides that will be used in them 
- Ekam: Continue working the dark mode into our project 
- THURSDAY: pair check in 

**Friday:**

- Both: Make an issue and submit a pull request


## Requirements (this is what we will show at N@TM):

- Functional dark mode
  - Must be automated
- Completed SASS lessons
  - Include both basic and advanced lessons
  - Have interactive parts so students can better understand SASS
