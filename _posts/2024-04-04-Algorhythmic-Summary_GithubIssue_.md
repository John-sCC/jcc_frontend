## Algorhythmic Group Summary
Overall, this was quite the experience. For a lot of us, it was very different than what we were used to, but we still gained a lot from it. Our understanding of sorting algorithms strengthened and our collaboration skills were put on full display in being able to not only coordinate times to meet for rehearsals, but giving each other directing notes for acting. Each individual put in effort too, as we all had our lines completely memorized (how many other teams did that?)

## Algorhythmic Group Rehearsals
Our group was able to complete 3 different rehearsals together during Office Hours and Lunch. Additionally on Tuesday both periods were able to do a short practice within their designated CSA Period.
