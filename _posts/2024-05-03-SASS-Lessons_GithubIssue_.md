GOAL: To create a series of SASS assignments with attached video lessons for future students to reference

* Mini Lesson Topics
* Basic notation
* Mixins and functions, loops, conditions
* Extend/Inheritance
* Default variables
* Partial files and importing
* Compiling SASS


Other ideas if the ones above don't work:

* responsive designs with SASS
* SASS maps
