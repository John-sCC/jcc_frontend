title: 'N@tM Feedback'
layout: post
description : Automatically Populated Github Issue
---

## Procedure

The biggest part about our project is that it hinges a lot on student interaction. As a result, feedback from students and teachers is what we value most going forward. There are certainly more features to be implemented next trimester that are set in stone, but students at the event will be a big part in finding gaps in our plan.

For each user that comes around to the table, before they leave, we plan to ask them these questions:
- How would you change or improve the features you saw today?
- What do you think about the site's visual design?

One of our group members will have this issue open and take notes in the sections below. The user won't have to type anything out.

## Feedback on the User Experience

Feedback on the UI and styling:
- A lot of blue and green (not contrast) but it looks organized
- Image rec looks separate from the rest of the project
- Make the site louder!
  - Bright colors :D
  - Noise when a button is pressed (possibly joke)
- BIG NOTE: Dumb everything down for users
  - Compsci parent mentioned that things are already well-organized, but should be even more accessible for new users because it would increase engagement
  - We plan to do this by adding ClassPeriod attributes for images to represent the class (easier recognition), bigger cards on dashboard for classes and clearer delineation between features

## Feedback on Features
- have the data automatically sent into a google doc/sheet (or just have a way for the data to save  into a csv file or directly exporting the data itself <-- ekam) 
- Ability to change the colors/theme and be more accessible to colorblind people
- Display a warning if an assignment is missing
  - Change the color of the box to red or add an icon
- Make the assignment list vertical to make it easier to read
 
Additional features or additions to features that we can add:
- Ability to change the colors/theme and be more accessible to colorblind people

## Planned Changes for Trimester 3

Taking into account this feedback, here are some objectives we wish to meet in Trimester 3:
- Remake the wireframe for our dashboard following user login to dumb it down/make it easier to read
  - Increase the size of class cards and add an identifying image/color
  - Instructions on accessing the class (where to click, etc.)
- Use colors/add an icon to assignments that are missing/late
  - This will be part of implementing the submissions for assignments
- With image recognition and graphing: convert data to CSV
  - This is a great way to intermix the graphing and image rec
- Overall design: make all pages fit with theme, and make that theme customizable
  - Aiden: Probably part of the overall site CSS/SASS would be changing all of a certain color in a settings menu accessible on each page, wireframe needed
- Separate data features from classroom features on dashboard, which was a prior plan

### Already Planned Improvements

- Finish thematic styling for all pages using site SASS (Aiden + others as necessary)
- Finish implementing user creation/login (Ekam, frontend)
- Finish implementing class and assignment creation with user login working for security (Drew, frontend)
- Develop frontend functionality for graphing; connect to image recognition (Toby, Raymond, Ishi)
- Create quiz subclass for assignment to act like Canvas quizzes (frontend and backend, AJ)
