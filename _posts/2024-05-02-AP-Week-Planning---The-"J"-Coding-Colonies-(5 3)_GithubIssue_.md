## SASS LESSONS

- **GOAL:** To create a series of SASS assignments with attached video lessons for future students to reference

### Mini Lesson Topics

1. Basic notation
2. Mixins and functions, loops, conditions
3. Extend/Inheritance
4. Default variables 
5. Partial files and importing
6. Compiling SASS
7. Dark mode/light mode
8. SASS architecture

Other ideas if the ones above don't work:
* Responsive designs with SASS
* SASS maps

[Something we can reference when making the lesson](https://gist.github.com/jareware/4738651)

### Implementation (Project)

We are going to create a class on our project containing all of these lessons as "assignments," that students can sign up for. These will also all be made in Jupyter notebooks for students to pull into their own repositories to test and play with.

## Other Project Work

We have decided that we have too many features and need to start polishing instead of making more. Heavy emphasis will be placed on styling (scss) which can also help us make assets for our lessons.
