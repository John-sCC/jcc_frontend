    "    - constructor\n",
    "    - private instances \n",
    "    - declare headers for class methods\n",
    "    - properly uses methods from given class\n",
    "    - methods returns the right thing based on logic\n",
    "2. Use meaningful variable names\n",
    "3. For inheritence questions, pay attention to whether the attribute is of the parent or child class\n",
    "4. Check your code with the examples provided\n",
    "5. Super() must be in the first line of your constructor\n",
    "6. Initialize your variables outside of the constructor and any method (to have the correct scope)\n",
    "7. Point distribution, very few given for functioning code, just ensure you have the basic requirements"
