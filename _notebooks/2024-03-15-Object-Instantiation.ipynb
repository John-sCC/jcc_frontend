    "# Farming Simulator\n",

    "This Java code simulates a farm field using a 2D array. The `Corn` class defines corn objects with age and moisture level. The `FarmingSimulator` class initializes the field with random Corn objects, provides a method to retrieve data at specific coordinates, and displays the field. Object instantiation creates a `FarmingSimulator` instance, allowing visualization of the field and access to Corn data. The `main()` method orchestrates the simulation by initializing the simulator, displaying the field, and demonstrating data retrieval. Overall, the code demonstrates object-oriented principles, encapsulation, and basic array manipulation to simulate a farming scenario.\n",
